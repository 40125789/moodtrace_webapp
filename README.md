Welcome to the Mood Trace web application! This app allows users to record their moods and analyze their emotions over time. Follow the steps below to set up and use the application.

Notes:
This web app folder does not include the node_modules folder containing the required dependencies for the project - the NPM command "npm install" can instead be used in the Terminal to generate the node_modules folder and download the packages listed in package.json with all required dependencies. Once dependencies are successfully installed, start the application by running "npm start" within the terminal. This will launch the application locally. This web app was built on Windows and does not contain a "MACOSX" folder.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/index. This will bring you to the landing page of the Mood Trace website.

Log In: Click on "Log in" within the navigation bar and use the provided login credentials.
Registration: If you don't have an account, click on "Registration" to create a new one.
